      <p class="grid_8">LIHFS is a modern martial arts organization dedicated to studying, 
      \reconstructing and training with the German Longsword, the weapon central to Historical European Martial Arts (“HEMA”). 
      Our curriculum is based on the manuscript of 14th century German Master Johannes Liechtenauer. 
      In addition to our own interpretation and application of the Liechtenauer canon, 
      including prominent commentary by Peter Von Danzig, Paulus Kal, Andres Lignitzer, Sigmund Ringeck, and Ott Jud, 
      Hans Talhoffer and others, we have consulted with and incorporated relevant teachings of the leading modern day medieval fencing masters. 
      </p>
          <p class="grid_8">Through our ongoing research, LIHFS will bring to life the teachings of the historical masters via our proprietary Curriculum, 
          which is one of the most thorough and authentic programs available to the modern student. 
          Our Curriculum includes theoretical teachings and practical application through hands-on instruction from our Master-at-Arms, 
          solo drills, partnered exercises, and fencing with blunted and wooden long swords as well as wrestling. 
          In the interests of diversity, we will strive to bring other modern day masters to class from time to time 
          as guest instructors to exchange ideas and share best practices.
      </p>
      <p class="grid_8">We are led by experienced Longsword fencer Michael Capanelli and Bradley Rangell, 
      active HEMA Ambassador and advocate. We are advised by Gene Davis, 
      who is an expert swordsman with years of practical application, study and interpretations of the manuals. 
      Gene is also an archaeologist, and has helped to develop our curriculum</p>

     <p class="grid_8"> We are not a re-enactment or LARP organization
       We are not a theatrical or ‘stage-fighting’ group
       We are a martial arts group studying HEMA
       </p>

<p class="grid_8">If you are interested in studying and practicing this celebrated, historically accurate medieval martial art, 
then we bid you to join us. Please feel free to contact Michael Capanelli at mcapanelli@lihfs.com Brad Rangell at bran gall@lihfs.com
