   <h2>Equipment Suppliers and Manufacturers</h2>
   <h3><b><a href=””>Albion Swords:</a></b></h3>

<p class=”grid_8”> Albion makes some of the best training sword and sharps I’ve laid my hands on. Their pricy, but the expense is well justified. </p>

<h3><b><a href url=””>Arms and Armor:</a></b></h3>

Another high quality manufacturer. They make a very sturdy well handling sword. They also have a host of other high quality reproductions. 

<h3><b><a href=””>Peter Regenyei:</a></b></h3>

Peter is a European smith of some renown. He makes a very authentic Feder (Training sword) that is the standard in the European tournament circuit. His prices are very reasonable but his wait times my be a little long.

<h3><b><a href=””>Syzmon Cherbloski:</a></b></h3>

Another European smith who’s new on the scene. He make very good training swords for extremely reasonable prices. His wait times aren’t too bad either with orders running about 3 months. 

Gloves and gear:

<h3><b><a href=””>woodenswords.com:</a></b></h3>

This Company has been around since the beginnings of HEMA in America. They started out making high quality wooden wasters but since the majority of American groups have moved on the Synthetics and steel they have evolved to carry an array of equipment specifically for HEMA. 
Darkwood Armory: Another company that evolved with the times. They started out making Rapiers for the SCA crowd, and have since gone on the embrace HEMA by making a full line of fencing gear as well as high quality swords to train with. 

<h3><b><a href=””>SPES Historic:</a></b></h3>

This European company is on the cutting edge of technology as far as protection is concerned. Their Axel Peterson Pro fencing jacket is second to none. They also do custom sizing. 

<h3><b><a href=””>Absolute Force:</a></b></h3>

This company started as a sport fencing supplier but when HEMA started to catch on in the states they were one of the first to embrace it. They have everything from shoes to HEMA specific fencing masks and everything in between. 

<h2>Study Resources:</h2>

<h3><b><a href=””>ARMA:</a></b></h3>
 
This group has been around forever. John Clements, for better or worse, is the granddaddy of HEMA in America. This is the guy who started it all. His site has a wealth of information and is worth a days exploration for sure. 

<h3><b><a href=””>My Armoury:</a></b></h3>
A site dedicated to the study of historic arms and armor. Being here is a bit like spying in on the professor’s lounge in the medieval studies section of college. They have a very knowledgeable member base that runs the gambit from amateur historians to full fledged professors. 

<h3><b><a href=””>Sword Buyers Guide:</a></b></h3>

This site started as a resource for entry-level collectors. It has evolved in to so much more over the years. It’s pretty much the jolly little brother to My Armoury. The mood is light but the knowledge is just as formidable.
