    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 class="grid_10">Q: What does HEMA stand for?</h3>
<p class="grid_10">HEMA stands for Historical European Martial Arts.  </p>
<h3 class="grid_10">Q: Who studies with you?</h3>
<p class="grid_10">Our members come from many different walks of life. All of them joined in their passion for the fighting arts, as well as the unique bond of brotherhood that develops through intense yet friendly competition.  all walks of life. 
Some join for the competition, some for the experience, but all share a love for the combative arts of medieval Europe. </p>
<h3 class="grid_10">Q: Were there really martial arts in Europe?</h3>
<p class="grid_10">For every weapon around the world, there is a corresponding way of maximizing its effectiveness against an opponent. 
Some arts were passed orally, others like most of our arts, were written in detailed manuals. 
There are hundreds of manuals in libraries around the world, in various languages and dialects. </p>
<h3 class="grid_10">Q: Weren’t swords heavy?</h3>
 <p class="grid_10">Most swords were between 2.5 and 5lbs. While that may seem light by Hollywood’s standards,
