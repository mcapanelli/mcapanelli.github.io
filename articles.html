 <p class="wooden_fang">Introduction
 <br>
Just like many members of this forum, I’m a HEMA practitioner. 
I help run a study group called Long Island historical Fencing Society. 
With the influx of new members we’re always looking for training equipment to offer. 
Enter Jeff and Wooden Fang Blades. 
Jeff was looking to enter the HEMA and had a special offer for groups looking to try out his wears. 
I contacted him and the result was the swords in this review. 
<br>
Historical overview
<br>
Even though these are wooden wasters, Jeff did a fantastic job of giving these swords the proper geometry for their respective type. According to Oakeshott’s typology, the XVIIIc and XXa can be described as follows;
Typically, XVIIIc exhibit the following characteristics
<br> 
Large, hand-and-a-half sword with blade up to 34" (86.36cm)<br>
Faces of the flattened diamond section may be slightly convex<br>
Long grip with a pronounced bulge in its middle<br>
Cross often horizontally S-curved<br>
Pommel usually of wheel form
<br>
The XXa is a sub-group of the XX. These were long-gripped, fullered war swords with broad blades that usually had three fullers. Two short fullers surrounding a longer one. 
The main difference is the XXa sub-type tapered to an acute point for thrusting. 
Later on Oakeshott revised this group to become type XXI and XXII. 
<br>
Full Disclosure
<br>
“I received this sword as a review sword from Manufacturer X and did not pay full price for it,”
<br>
Initial Impressions
<br>
I received the swords from UPS and gleefully unpacked them. This is where the problems began. 
It seems UPS was a little over zealous with the package and broke the S curved guard on the XXa. 
The XVIIIc arrived in good order. 
I was looking forward to taking it to the Boston Sword Gathering seeing as it was the survivor of the two but alas, 
it died a very sad and sudden death as well, but more on that later though. 
Despite the UPS shenanigans and the pell drill from hell, it was easy to tell these swords were crafted with care and attention to detail. 
They easily beat any Purple heart or New Sterling Arms I’ve ever seen. 
The XVIIIc, the highlight to me, was very nice and drew many positive comments from the attendants of BSG despite being broken. 
<br>
Statistics
<br>
About that……The XXa, while very beautiful, was done in by UPS and therefore miss out on the Boston Sword Gathering she was supposed to attend. 
The XVIIIc, my favorite of the two swords by the way, broke the day after I received it. 
As I don’t have the swords on hand at the moment I’ll add the stats, or the stats of what’s left of them, at a later date. Not much later though as this review is WAY overdue
<br>
Handling Characteristics
<br>
XXa: This sword had a lot of blade presence, but was very true to type. 
I still can’t believe he made a wooden sword handle like my old Viceroy. 
This was very impressive work on Jeff’s part. 
This is the second best wooden sword I’ve ever handled. 
It actually felt better than some live blades I’ve used. Still, it’s only the second best.
<br>
XVIIIc: Wow…….wow…..that about sums it up. 
<br>
This is the best wooden sword I’ve ever used hands down. 
It actually felt like a real sword. We compared it head to head with Purpleheart and New Sterling Arms. 
This sword was the hand’s down winner. 
My only critique, and it’s a small one, is it could have been a little heavier. 
What it lacked in blade presence it made up for with lightning quick response time and super easy point control.
<br> 
Conclusions
<br>
Well as wooden swords go, Jeff seems to have found a way to make them feel as real as you can get without making them out of steel. 
It’s really a shame they died so soon as I would have liked to really put them through their paces. 
If Jeff can find a way to overcome the durability issues (Mind you we also broke the New Sterling Arms not long after the XVIIIc died) 
while maintaining the feel of these wasters I can’t imagine a study group or HEMA organization that wouldn’t want a wall full of these for the beginning students. 
Jeff made refined weapons that in no way sacrificed anything by being made out of wood. 
<br>
Pros
<br>
-Very nice construction with an even finish throughout.<br>
-Handeling that’s ture to type. You’ll find you have to remind yourself more than once your using a wooden waster.<br>
-Grips are well wrapped with cord and provide solid contact while looking damn good while they do it.
<br> 
Cons
<br>
-The “S” curved type 12 guard, while one of my favorites, seems to be a hard one to ship when made out of wood.
<br>
-Blades have durability issues
<br> 
The Bottom Line
<br>
Durability issues aside, these swords are so nice they don’t deserve to be called waters. 
Jeff really outdid himself and in my opinion for solo work and light two man drills these can’t be beat as they simulate metal 
far better than anything else on the market right now, nylon included. 
If he can fix the durability issue when they’re used with intent without sacrificing the feel of these swords 
I think he’ll have a real winner that would easily, if advertised right, dethrone Purpleheart and New Sterling.
