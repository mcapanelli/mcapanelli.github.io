       <p>LIHFS is a modern martial arts organization dedicated to studying, reconstructing and training with the German Longsword, the weapon central to Historical European Martial Arts (“HEMA”). 
       Our curriculum is based on the manuscript of 14th century German Master Johannes Liechtenauer.  
       In addition to our own interpretation and application of the Liechtenauer canon, including prominent commentary by Peter Von Danzig, Paulus Kal, Andres Lignitzer, Sigmund Ringeck, and Ott Jud, Hans Talhoffer and others, 
       we have consulted with and incorporated relevant teachings of the leading modern day medieval fencing masters. 
       LIHFS holds classes at Island Fencing Academy in Plainview NY.,</P>
