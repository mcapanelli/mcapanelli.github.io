 <p>All three sites analyzed exhibited a much more advanced user interface with a focus on visual presentation.
 While Chicago Swordplay Guild and Virginia Academy of Fencing are well put together and easy to navigate, 
 Blood and Iron is by far the most visually attractive of the three sites. 
 It's no wonder that this site surpasses the others by a good margin.

    <h3>Goals for Redesign</h3>
     <p>The main goal of this redesign is to provide lihfs.org with a modern and visually appealing site that is easy to navigate and uncluttered. 
     We not only want users to be able to easily find the information they need, we want to encourage them through planned placement of site resources to navigate through 
     the site and have a pleasant experience doing so. 
     The main focus will be on visuals and better placement of resources throughout the site 
     with interactivity a priority as well. 
   </p>
     <p>It is believed that by making these changes the client will increase their web presence 
     and become a stronger force in the greater HEMA community. The improvement of the UI will encourage 
     visitors to navigate through the site and spend more time reading the content. This will serve to improve their ranking and also 
     their standing in the community which they serve. 
     
   </p>
     <p>By focusing on these elements the client will give a content rich experience the its end users with pleasing 
     visuals and intuitive navigation. Increased membership is also a goal and with a greater web presence and smartly laid out content 
     the conversion rate of casual visitors will be increased thus increasing the membership of the client and enhancing
     the study experience of its membership through a larger, more vibrant student base.
