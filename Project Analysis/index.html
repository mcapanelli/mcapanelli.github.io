    <h1>Project Analysis</h1>
    <h3>Client: Wilson’s Barbecue</h3>
    <h3>Project: Website Redesign</h3>
    <h3>Designer: Michael Capanelli</h3>
 </header>
 <div id=”site_intent”>
  <h2>Site Intent</h2> 
     <p>Wilson’s Barbecue is a traditional smokehouse and BBQ restaurant located In Fairfield Connecticut. Wilson’s is a family owned and operated business operated for the love of cooking. That love is translated in to well crafted traditional dishes made with care. The majority of business is from referrals of satisfied customers. There’s a very lived in, simple feel from the storefront to the interior of this family restaurant. While the food is well put together, the website is haphazardly thrown together at best. </p>
     <p>The site has a simple background and logo. The navigation is not user friendly at all and the site lacks overall polish and has a serious lack of content to engage a user. I feel that taking the website In to the 21st century would attract a new, younger, more vibrant customer base and help propel Wilson’s to the top of their game. </p>

   <h2>Goals for Redesign:</h2>
   <ul class="fix_list">

     <li>Bring the site to current HTML and CSS standards. </li>
     <li>Make the site responsive so it will render cleanly on multiple devices</li>

     <td>N/A</td>
     </tr>
  </table>
  <p>All the sites, while not being terribly polished, are far more user friendly and are at least not a haphazard collection of unarranged information. 
  The best site of the four, Famous Dave’s, is an attractive site and its effectiveness can be seen in its ranking compared to the other sites in this analysis. 
  A well made functional site would most certainly raise the web presence, and thus the business potential, of Wilson’s Barbecue. </p>

  <div id=”target_audience”>
 <h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
     <p>The target audience for a restaurant is varied and coves a wide demographic and as such makes zeroing in on a user persona rather difficult. There is no specific age or gender demographic being targeted by Wilson’s. So using the family oriented nature of the restaurant I’ll we’ll look at two very different personas </p>
   <p>Personas:</p>
   </div>
    <div id=”columns”>
       <h4> Jane Smith</h4>
        <p>Age: 42</p>
        <p>Location: Fairfax, connecticut </p>
        <p>Gender: Female</p>
        <p>Education: BA in design</p>
        <p>Income: 57,500 per year</p>
        <p>Martial status: Married</p>
        <p>Children: 2</p>
   <p>Jane is a working mom who has a household to run as well. 
   She wants something fact but not necessarily fast food to feed her family. 
   While they are generally health conscious, they occasionally look for well made food as a treat. </p>
       <h4>Matt Wilson</h4>
          <p>Age: 27</p>
          <p>Location: New York, NY</p>
          <p>Gender: Male</p>
          <p>Education: Tech School</p>
          <p>Income: 35,000 per year</p>
          <p>Matrital status: Single</p>
          <p>Childern: none</p>
   <p>Matt is an auto mechanic who works long hours during the week.
   On weekends he likes to travel east with his Girlfriend and find new places to visit.
   He's a little closed minded as far as food is concerned being a "meat and potatoes" kind of man.
   While he may not be that adventurous when it comes to food, he does like a good BBQ
   and will go out of his way to find it. he tends to be loyal once he finds something he likes </p>
