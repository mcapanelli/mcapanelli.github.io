 <h4> Bradley Rangel</h4>
 <p class="article">Brad Rangell is the co-founder of Long Island Historical Fencing Society along with Mike Capanelli. 
 His group is currently studying Lichtenauer's system with a particular focus on the Longsword ("LIHFS"). 
 The group is growing rapidly with a dozen students currently attending regular classes.
Since he travels often for work, Brad is lucky enough to be a true 'journeyman' and frequently studies with several well known HEMA groups across the country and internationally as well, 
including Chicago Swordplay Guild (Greg Mele), NYHFA (Mike Edelson), London Longsword Academy (Dave Rawlings), Die Schlatschule (Hugh Knight), Meyer Friefechter (Mike Cartier), and several of Christian Tobler's students, to name just a few. 
As a traveling ambassador, Brad strives to learn as much as he can and bring best practices to LIHFS and the HEMA community in general.
Brad is a proponent of cross-training with other athletic activities and was a competitive runner in high school and college. 
Today, when he doesn't have a longsword in his hands, Brad continues to be active in competetive tennis, roller hockey, basketball and other sports.
Brad lives in Woodbury, Long Island, with his wife, two sons, and daughter Gracie (a four year old Golden Doodle).</p>

<h4>Michael Capanelli</h4>
<p>Michael is an avid fencer and is the co-founder of LIHFS along with Brad Rangel.  
Michael started fencing 6 years ago under the guidance of Gene Davis, an accomplished fencer and JSA instructor.  
Starting in the Italian system, he switched to the German school when forming his own study group. 
He has since continued his journey in the German school of fence with LIHFS. 
Having experience with various Eastern full contact martial arts in his younger years, Michael brings a martial mindset to his fencing classes 
and always teaches to fight with intent and in earnest. </p>
